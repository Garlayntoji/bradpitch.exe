# Brad Pitch.exe: a Discord bot.
# This readme file will obviously be edited in the future.

# To introduce myself, I'm Garlayn Toji (wow, surprising). I'm making this bot so it will be able to do kinda everything. Moderation isn't sure though.
# I started programming with Python, then I learned the basics of Java and Javascript, and also HTML5/CSS3.

# Anyways, thank you for using my bot, even if it doesn't do many things at the moment.
