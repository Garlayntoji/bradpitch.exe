# Brad Pitch.exe: a Discord bot.
This readme file will obviously be edited in the future.

To introduce myself, I'm Garlayn Toji (wow, surprising). I'm making this bot so it will be able to do kinda everything. Moderation isn't sure though.
I started programming with Python, then I learned the basics of Java and Javascript, and also HTML5/CSS3.

Anyways, thank you for using my bot, even if it doesn't do many things at the moment.

## September 16 2020 update:
The bot development is currently in pause. I begin my studies in an engineering school, so my time for working on this personal project is more limited. Please consider that there will be at least an update per week. The bot is currently down because I brought the bot host, my Raspberry Pi, with me. I cannot host Brad Pitch.exe in my new home because I did a test with the connection I have there, which is average. When you summon the b!meme command, a time-out error appears everytime with my connection in my new home. I wait the end of the week to re-plug my Pi at my parents' home so at the end of the week, the bot should be up again and ready to go.
